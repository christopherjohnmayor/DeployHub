# CONTINUE GUIDE FINDER APP DEVELOPMENT

## Context

- The app uses Shadcn-ui for all major UI components (Input, Card, Accordion).
- AI guide generation is fully integrated in the UI, with user feedback via toasts.
- Admin panel is implemented for reviewing, editing, and deleting guides, with advanced features (feedback/rating).
- Validation and error handling are in place for all major actions.
- **Simple password-based authentication now restricts access to the admin panel.**

## Next Steps

- Polish UI further as needed (visual consistency, accessibility, feedback).
- (Optional) Implement multi-language support for guides and UI.
- (Optional) Enhance authentication (JWT, OAuth, etc).
- Continue to improve accessibility and user feedback throughout the app.

## Instructions

Continue development by further polishing the UI for accessibility and feedback, optionally adding multi-language support, and considering more advanced authentication. Ensure all UI remains visually consistent and modern using Shadcn-ui. Reference PRD.md, Roadmap, and Progress.md for requirements and completed features.
